                I am one of hodočašće members and my name is Ibrahim Bećirović. I started this project of making a 
                webiste on my own just from watching and following courses on <a href="https://www.udemy.com " target="_blank">Udemy</a>.
                This site is now the second made site made from scratch representing the group hodočašće. That group is basically a
                group of 5 friends kind of different from others, having their own way of communication and understanding. Basically 5 friends
                with same things in common. I didn't use to like HTML at first but now when I got into it it's actually really cool and I love
                how it's all connected with other languages such as CSS or JS. My favorite part of it is CSS, also known as the designing language
                used to help HTML. Well myself I love working on design even if it's a powerpoint presentation. Other than that I like playing
                computer games with my friends or alone. My favorite game and the game I have spent the most hours on is Rocket League and I think
                it is going the be like that for a while, or even forever. I don't want this to be that long for you to stop reading so this is the
                end of my introduction.
